Peek Platform - Client Service Frontend
=======================================

The Peek Client service frontend is where Peek Apps run the frontend of their user
interface.

The frontend is for typescript + bootstrap3 + angular2

Development
-----------

The frontend is compiled/built from the backend python software when it starts. The python
backend then serves up the the webpack bundles. This is accessible via http://<ip>:8000

When you are developing with the frontend, you can start it in development mode

    cd <project dir>/peek_server_fe/src
    npm start

This will start a NODE development server. It will watch the project files, rebulld the
project and live reload the browser when you make changes.
It's accessed via http://<ip>:4200

There is a proxy.conf.json file that is configured to pass through certain resources to
the backend server. This allows the NODE development server to hand handle all the assets
and the backend to still handle the file uploads, vortex, etc.
